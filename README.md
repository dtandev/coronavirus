* A few days ago we lunched map application: www.wirusnamapie.pl . Enjoy! :)

## 25/03/2020
* Sometimes information from 2 different sources doesn't match. When it happens, we choose information based on source, which is more local.


## 18/03/2020
* The government map about the diagnosed patients was generalized to voivodeships. The earlier map was divided into counties. Now, if we cannot match patients to their cities, the value in the 'city' column is filled in accordance with the following criteria:

### Order of importance in 'city' column
1. City where a patient lives
2. County capital, where a patient lives
3. Place where the patient stays in the hospital
4. Voivodeship capital, where a patient lives

## 17/03/2020 
* Since yesterday the Ministry of Health stopped inform about cities where patients were diagnosed. We have information only about voivodeships. 

We hope that this data will be useful to those producing visualizations or analyses.

Data was collected by GeoSiN Scientific Club Members from University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland (www.geosin.pl).
